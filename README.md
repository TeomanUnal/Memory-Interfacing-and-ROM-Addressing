# Memory-Interfacing-and-ROM-Addressing

This project deals with memory interfacing and ROM addressing. It aims to access data stored in a Read-Only Memory (ROM) controlled by a microcontroller or embedded system and send this data to external devices. By reading data from specific ROM addresses, the program interacts with various external devices, providing a foundational structure for accessing and controlling fixed data stored in ROM for diverse applications.
